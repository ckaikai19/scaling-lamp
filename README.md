# GitChat 

GitChat is a chat client that brings developers together to communicate and collaborate with one another. GitChat is designed to combat isolation and 'developer fatigue' by providing a more visceral development experience for new and seasoned developers. 

## Usage

GitChat is a web-based service in which users can create, choose and comment on different 'Gits' and projects. Users are directed to a landing page to login or sign up.  Upon accessing the site users may begin to target and chat about various topics.
